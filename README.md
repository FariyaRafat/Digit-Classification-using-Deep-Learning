# Digit_Classification_using_Deep_Learning_on_MNIST_Dataset
This project implements a Handwritten Digit Recognition System using Deep Learning (Convolutional Neural Networks - CNN) on the popular MNIST dataset. The objective is to automatically recognize and classify handwritten digits (0–9) from grayscale images with high accuracy.

Traditional machine learning techniques like SVM and KNN require manual feature extraction, which is time-consuming and less robust. In contrast, CNNs automatically learn hierarchical features directly from images, resulting in significantly better performance.

The model is developed using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras, and achieves ~99% accuracy on the test dataset, making it highly reliable for real-world applications such as OCR, banking automation, and document digitization.
